<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022, along with other telecom providers.


However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.

I worked on an analytics Codebasics project for 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐𝐨 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦, one of the leading telecom providers in India. 
After launching their 5G plans in May 2022, the company observed a drop in active users and slower revenue growth.

To help the management identify reasons and opportunities, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard comparing KPIs before vs after the 5G launch.

🔹 Total Revenue, ARPU, Active Users & Unsubscribed Users

🔹 City-wise and Plan-wise Revenue Trends

🔹 Market Share Comparison Across Competitors

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐝:

➡️ ARPU increased by ~11%, but active users declined slightly.

➡️ Unsubscribed users rose sharply in some key cities post-5G launch.

➡️ Certain plans performed exceptionally well, while others underperformed.

This dashboard enables management to analyse pricing, marketing campaigns, and network quality to optimise future 5G adoption strategies.
