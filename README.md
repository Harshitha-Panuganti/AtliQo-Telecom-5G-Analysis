🚀 AtliQo Telecom 5G Analysis Dashboard

Function- Executive Management

I worked on an analytics Codebasics project for 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐𝐨 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦, one of the leading telecom providers in India. 
After launching their 5G plans in May 2022, the company observed a drop in active users and slower revenue growth.

To help the management identify reasons and opportunities, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard comparing KPIs before vs after the 5G launch.
🔹 Total Revenue, ARPU, Active Users & Unsubscribed Users
🔹 City-wise and Plan-wise Revenue Trends
🔹 Market Share Comparison Across Competitors

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐝:
➡️ ARPU increased by ~11%, but active users declined slightly.
➡️ Unsubscribed users rose sharply in some key cities post-5G launch.
➡️ Certain plans performed exceptionally well, while others underperformed.
𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞:
 This dashboard enables management to analyse pricing, marketing campaigns, and network quality to optimise future 5G adoption strategies.
